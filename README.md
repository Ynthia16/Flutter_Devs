# AgroSales: Agritech Project for Trimester 2.3 using Flutter

## About The Project

AgroSales aims to revolutionize the agricultural landscape in Rwanda and Africa by providing a marketplace mobile application. This platform enables farmers to compete fairly in the market without middlemen. Understanding the structural barriers in many African countries, the app also offers services via USSD technology. Additionally, it features an agronomy support section where farmers can access real-time information and advice to enhance their agricultural practices.

## Getting Started

This project serves as a starting point for developing a Flutter application.

### Useful Resources for Beginners:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For further assistance with Flutter development, explore the [online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which provides tutorials, samples, mobile development guidance, and a comprehensive API reference.

## Assignment 1 - Week Ending 31st May

### Instructions

In your project groups, design an exercise incorporating all the following widgets and submit it on Canvas by Friday night. Volunteers from each group will demonstrate some of these widgets in the next session on Friday. Participation in the presentation will be graded.

Each group should assign roles as follows: 
- Researcher: Checks the documentation on how to implement a widget/component.
- Coder: Implements the widget/component.
- Debugger: Ensures good code quality.

Roles should be swapped every 5 minutes.

### Widgets to Implement

Refer to [Flutter Widgets](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/widgets) for documentation and implement the following in your project:

- **Basic Widgets**: `MaterialApp`, `Scaffold`, `Center`, `Row`, `Column`, `ListView`, `Stack`, `Grid`
- **Layout Widgets**: `Expanded`, `Align`, `Container`, `Padding`, `Transform`, `ConstrainedBox`, `FittedBox`, `RotatedBox`, `SizedBox`, `Positioned`
- **Interactive Widgets**: `Buttons` (Text, Elevated, Outlined, etc.), `Chip`, `Menu Items`
- **Display Widgets**: `Text`, `Icons`, `Image`
- **App Structure and Navigation**: `AppBar`, `BottomNavigationBar`, `FloatingActionButton (FAB)`

### Submission Guidelines

Each team member must submit a GitHub link to their work. It is recommended to integrate these widgets into your actual project to ensure consistent progress.

This is a graded activity, and individual contributions will be assessed based on commits. Lack of commitment will result in fewer marks. Note that there are no deadline extensions for these weekly activities; missed submissions will not be reconsidered.
