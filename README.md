# AgroSales

A journey towards realizing our agritech project for trimester 2.3 using Flutter and other technologies.

## About The Project

Agrosales is poised to revolutionize the agriculture landscape in Rwanda and Africa at large, one transaction at a time. We provide a marketplace mobile application that enables farmers to compete fairly in the market without the hassle of middlemen.Understanding the structural barriers in many african countries, we are also providing the services on the mobile app via USSD technology. We also noticed that farmers dont have access to expert knowledge in all matters agriculture hence our app will feature an agronomy support section where farmers get realtime information and advice for better agricultura; experiences.

## Assignment 1-Week Ending 31st May

#### Instructions

* In your project groups, come up with an exercise(recommended to use your project) that incorporates all these widgets, and submit it on Canvas Friday night. We need volunteer groups to present and demonstrate some of these widgets in the next session on Friday  (Note: it will be graded towards participation)
Each group will have a researcher who checks the documentation on how to implement a widget/component, coder, and debugger to ensure good code quality. Roles will be swapped every 5 mins.

* Refer to https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/widgets for the widgets below and complete 

* the task on the next slide in your project groups:

MaterialApp, Scaffold, Center, Row, Column, Listview, Stack, Grid

* Submission type: Everyone in the team will submit a GitHub link your your work. It's highly recommended that you implement these widgets in your actual projects to make sure that every week you are making progress.


* This is a graded activity and I will be looking at the commits from every team member. Less commitment to the project repo means you get fewer marks.

* There are NO Deadline Extensions for these weekly activities, once you miss it, don't reach out to the coach.
