## Assignment 1-Week Ending 31st May

#### Instructions

* In your project groups, come up with an exercise(recommended to use your project) that incorporates all these widgets, and submit it on Canvas Friday night. We need volunteer groups to present and demonstrate some of these widgets in the next session on Friday  (Note: it will be graded towards participation)
Each group will have a researcher who checks the documentation on how to implement a widget/component, coder, and debugger to ensure good code quality. Roles will be swapped every 5 mins.

* Refer to the Flutter official documentationLinks to an external site. for the widgets below and complete 

* the task on the next slide in your project groups:

MaterialApp, Scaffold, Center, Row, Column, Listview, Stack, Grid

FittedBox, RotatedBox, SizedBox, Positioned 
Icons, Image, Chip, Menu Items.

* Submission type: Everyone in the team will submit a GitHub link your your work. It's highly recommended that you implement these widgets in your actual projects to make sure that every week you are making progress.


* This is a graded activity and I will be looking at the commits from every team member. Less commitment to the project repo means you get fewer marks.

* There are NO Deadline Extensions for these weekly activities, once you miss it, don't reach out to the coach.
